        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a current 2nd year student at UC Riverside pursuing my bachelor degree in Business Management and Marketing and looking towards options to advance my education and recieve a masters in another field of business. I have been studying classes in the realms of business, computer sciences, and mathematics to help me with my career in the future. It has been a great focus of mine to excel in all of these classes to make me a more well rounded asset to any company that I would have the utmost privelede in working with. My dedication and effort is something that extends from beyond school, work, to the way I carry myself everyday in life.  <br><br>

        In highschool I participated in many extracurriculars and involved myself into student governemnt in order to expand my perspectives and experiences to people of all backgrounds and motives. I played water polo, swim, baseball, basketball, and became captain of the volleyball team. These years spent playing sports really helped me develop my character and work ethic as practices would take place for 3 hours after school and even sometimes 2 hours before school. Having been involved in so many sports and balancing school work at the same time, it really forced me to bcome the best version of myself in able to excel in school and get good grades and at the same time keep up with the demanding physical and mental burden of sports. The greatest and most character defining experience of my highschool career was being a part of student government. I served as class president my freshman and sophmore year, vice president of ASB my junior year, and became the president of my school senior year. Being in this positioned allowed me the ability to connect with so many other peolpe from different clubs and backgrounds and also connected me to high leading officials in my district office. It was an honor to be able to hear from and help so many other people around campus, plan and coordinate school events, and collaborate with other leaders across the state. I am forever grateful and thankful for that opputunity and it is something that I hold near and dear to my heart till this day.<br><br>

        Being from Southern California, I have had the privledege to have been exposed to so many different business structures and cultures that exists in our modern society. There are so many different busineeses around me from small mom and pops to large corporate companies so being an avid explorer, I am able to visit these places and endulge myself into them and observe the way they run their businesses according to their size and location. It is important to me to adhere with the current market for all businesses and to study the ways that advertisements work and result in success. I have had the privilede of working with three companies so far since the age of 15 in the tech and food industry to be able to get a hands on experience with what runs a company and the planning and background works to enable a smooth everyday business flow. I am looking to expand my skills as a worker learner and be a useful asset to any company.
